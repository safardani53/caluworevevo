She has also formerly served as an Associate News Editor at the Huffington Post.</p><p>Her stint in the entertainment industry has seen the writer act in movies, too. She has appeared in films such as Forrest Gump (1994) and That Thing You Do! (1996).</p><p>But out of many who recognize Elizabeth and follow her, her profession and work have very little to contribute to her popularity. That is because she has earned more fame and recognition for being the daughter of renowned Hollywood actor Tom Hanks, even though she never asked for it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6_-K1jJRLp/</p></figure><p>Her recognition as a celebrity daughter and parallelly earned fame has somehow made her own works unnoticed and unappreciated.</p><p>Through this article, learn majorly about Elizabeth’s life, including her age, family details, career, net worth, and personal life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Details about Elizabeth’s Age, Measurements, and Education</h2><p>Elizabeth was born on May 17, 1982, in Los Angeles, California. Her nickname is Liz, and her <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/actress/shadow-and-bone-star-jessica-mei-li-wiki-bio-age-height-ethnicity-career/ rel="noreferrer noopener">birth date</a> suggests her birth sign to be Taurus.</p><p>While growing up, she studied at The Archer School for Girls, located in Brentwood, California. She graduated from there in June 2001. Later, she enrolled at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, for higher education.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Elizabeth’s body measurements, including her height and weight, is unknown, as she or any outlet has not revealed the details so far. But her images evidently show that she is a tall woman with complementing body size.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Daughter of Tom Hanks and Samantha Lewes</h2><p>Elizabeth is the daughter of actor Tom Hanks. Tom gave birth to her with his first wife, late Samantha Lewes, whom Tom had divorced in 1987.</p><p>Being the second child and only daughter of Tom, she has 3 siblings, all brothers, altogether.</p><p>Elizabeth’s blood sibling is her elder brother Colin Hanks and her other two brothers, Chester “Chet” Hanks and Truman Theodore Hanks, are her step-siblings, born from her father’s second marriage with Rita Hanks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her Parents’ Divorce</h2><p>Elizabeth’s parents Tom and Samantha had married in 1978, and together, they gave birth to a son Colin Hanks, born in 1977, and Elizabeth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>But their marriage came to an end in 1987 after the actor built closeness with his now-wife, Rita Hanks.</p><p>And despite separating with her for another relationship [which later turned into marriage], Tom went through some hard times post-separation, especially thinking about his children.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel=noopener>Graham Bensinger</a>, he recalled that he felt bad about his relationship with his children, as he thought that his kids felt abandoned by him. “Horribly painful time,” Tom said.</p><p>“Fraught with emotion and bad feelings and you know, the failures that you go ‘I couldn’t be a worse father and I couldn’t be a worse human being.’ I remember all those feelings of as though I had cursed innocent beings with my own failings.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her Mother Samantha Passed Away</h2><p>If the separation of her parents wasn’t enough, Elizabeth also had to experience the passing away of her mother, Samantha, when she was only 20 years old.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BgPEcSBjaX0/</p></figure><p>In 2001, Samantha was <a href=# rel=noopener>diagnosed</a> with bone cancer and afterward went through several treatments. Her ex-husband Tom even made arrangements to ensure that she was treated by the best bone-cancer specialists at UCLA and even paid their fees.</p><p>But the doctors determined that her cancer had spread to her lungs and her brain after several efforts.</p><p>On March 12, 2002, Samantha passed away in Sacramento, California, after about a year-long battle with cancer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her Father Tom Married Rita Hanks</h2><p>After separating from her mother, Samantha, Elizabeth’s father, Tom quickly got hitched with his lover Rita Hanks. Tom and Rita <a href=# rel=noopener>tied</a> the knots on April 30, 1988.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Together, the couple welcomed two children: Chet Hanks in 1990 and Truman Theodore in 1995.</p><p>After her mother’s passing away, Elizabeth and her elder brother Colin were adopted by Tom and Rita.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Father Has Fond Memories of Elizabeth’s Early Days</h2><p>The celebrated actor had fond memories of Elizabeth when she was growing up. Speaking with <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a>, Tom talked about his children with his first wife and how they saw him as an ordinary guy in his early 20s.</p><p>He said that his son Colin and his daughter Elizabeth were born when he was very young—to be precise, he was 21-year-old when he became a father for the first time.</p><p>“My son [Colin] was born when I was very young. As well as my daughter,” Tom stated.</p><p>He further expressed that he always maintained a good understanding with his children [Colin and Elizabeth] because they remember him as a guy who struggled to make a living and pay rent.</p><p>We have this gestalt understanding because [Colin and Elizabeth] remember when their dad was just a guy trying to, you know, make the rent.</p><p>Tom even compared his other two children from his second wife Rita with his first two children, saying, “My other kids, they were born after I had established a beachhead in every way. And so their lives were just different.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elizabeth’s Career: Woman of Many Talents</h2><p>To date, Elizabeth has tried her hands in many careers, including acting in movies and TV shows, writing stories for magazines, and authoring books. And somehow, she has managed to receive acknowledgment for all her works.</p><p>That being said, she has been most active as a writer and lately working on her first novel for children titled Piper Peregrine Vs. The Consortium For Better Thinking.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, it is not disclosed when it will get published. But if we go by her social media bio, her book is to get published in 2022.
