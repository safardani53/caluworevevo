Tolkien and is set during the Second Age of Middle-earth.</p><p>The original Lord of the Rings flick - The Fellowship of the Ring - launched the careers of stars <a href=#>Elijah Wood</a> and Viggo Mortensen, who were joined by a cast of famous faces.</p><p>Here we take a look at what the stars who played the Fellowship crew are up to now.</p><h2>Elijah Wood - Frodo Baggins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/RM-lord-1-comp.jpg><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE WHERE ARE THEY NOW">READ MORE WHERE ARE THEY NOW</h2><p>American actor Elijah, now 41, played Frodo Baggins in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which catapulted him to stardom after a string of previous child acting roles from the age of eight.</p><p>He went on to appear in a range of films including Spy Kids 3D: Game Over, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Sing City and Green Street, and leant his voice to Mumble in Happy Feet.</p><p>Elijah founded a record label - Simian Records - in 2005 but it was dissolved 10 years later after only bagging two bands for its roster.</p><p>He dated the drummer of punk band Gogol Bordello, Pamela Racine, for five years but allegedly broke it off in 2010 because he "didn't want to settle down".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>He now shares a son with Danish producer Mette-Marie Kongsved. They have been together for five years after meeting on the set of I Don't Feel At Home In This World Anymore in 2017.</p><p>Elijah caused a media storm in 2016 when he suggested child star sexual abuse was more rife in Hollywood than had been reported.</p><p>He told The Sunday Times: "There are a lot of vipers in this industry, people who only have their own interests in mind. There is darkness in the underbelly."</p><h2>Viggo Mortensen - Aragorn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/RM-lord-2-comp.jpg><p>Now 63, Viggo achieved Hollywood hunk status thanks to his role as brave warrior Aragorn.</p><p>He often performed his own stunts - and didn't go without injury - and bought two horses which he rode and bonded with while filming the trilogy.</p><p>Roles in films A History of Violence, Eastern Promises and Captain Fantastic followed, as well as a handful of theatre performances.</p><p>The Danish-American star was married to punk rocker Exene Cervenka for a decade between 1987 and 1997, and they share a son, Henry. He's been with Spanish actress Ariadna Gil - 10 years his junior - since 2009.</p><p>Viggo has been nominated for three&nbsp;Academy Awards, three&nbsp;BAFTA Awards and four&nbsp;Golden Globe Awards, and won a Screen Actors Guild Award.</p><p>In 2018, Viggo was forced to apologise after using the N-word during a live panel while promoting his film Green Book, for which he was tipped for an Oscar, but controversially lost out to Rami Malek, sparking rumours of a snub. The film itself won Best Picture.</p><p>He also blasted criticism that the film played into a white saviour narrative, claiming it was "inaccurate, mendacious and...based on a load of bulls***".</p><h2>Liv Tyler - Arwen Undómiel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/RM-lord-3-comp.jpg><p>Lord of the Rings was the second major film role for <a href=#>Liv</a>, after she starred alongside Bruce Willis in Armageddon.</p><p>She went on to land parts in Jersey Girl, The Incredible Hulk and Ad Astra, as well as HBO series The Leftovers, among others.</p><p>Like her dad, Aerosmith legend Steven Tyler, Liv, now 45, is a singer and appeared as a guest vocalist on The Lemonheads' album Varshons in 2009.
