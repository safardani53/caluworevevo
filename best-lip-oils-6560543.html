Often formulated with natural ingredients, lip oils aim to restore the thin skin of your lips to a smooth and hydrated state after being dry or cracked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Maintaining healthy moisture levels is critical for the lips as they don’t have oil glands or any natural moisturizer,” explains dermatological nurse Natalie Aguilar, esthetician to Sofia Vergara and Rita Ora. No matter how good you are about your daily water intake, your lips will most likely always need a little TLC from some sort of moisturizer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lip oils have become somewhat of a trend within the beauty space, with brands from NYX to Dior debuting their signature concoctions of natural oils and sometimes a hue or two.

This oil exceeded our expectations in terms of feel, hydration, and longevity — making this little tube stand out from the crowd even more than its glittery formula already does. It was beyond smooth on our lips, never feeling clumpy or goopy, without being so thin that could slide off of our lips. We loved that it was non-greasy despite having a slick consistency, which made it easy to wear all day. No more sticky, heavy glosses for us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because its formula is gel-based, we found that our lips stayed hydrated for longer when we wore this lippie over the others. And when we reapplied a few more times to more of the silvery sparkles onto our lips, the formula didn’t glob up or get bulky — it just glided on like a shimmering wash of nourishment, leaving our lips looking juicier than a plumper could.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What also impressed us, though, was its staying power. Even after 30 minutes of wear, we still had the super-slick lips that we had when we first swabbed it on. The jojoba oil and antioxidant-rich formula kept our lips hydrated and soft even after eating things like granola bars, and the infused hyaluronic acid helped our lips appear more supple and full without the burning sensation that comes with most plumpers. Earning a shiny 4.95 out of 5 stars, this lip oil is the closest thing we can find to perfection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.18 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Antioxidants, jojoba oil, hyaluronic acid | <strong>Fragranced: </strong>No | <strong>Finish:</strong> Shiny, sparkly | <strong>Shades:&nbsp;</strong>6<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-nooni-lip-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nooni Lip Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon NOONI Lip Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/CEJsgBjf2YfW-_Qo-bnNwXp3R10=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nooni-c9233293f810431495ee40afae833b8d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear/Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Technically doubles as a stain, making this a great multitasking product</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Color came completely off when wiped clean with a makeup wipe</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Never slipped off our lips or feathered onto the skin</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It seems like there’s a new beauty trend every day, and we can’t possibly buy into all of them. But when it comes to lip oils, this kind of product is certainly one that everyone should implement into their routines — and the Nooni Lip Oil is the perfect, budget-friendly way to try out this kind of product without splurging. This comfortable, tinted oil left a slick sheen on our lips that gave our pouts an extra dose of moisture while amping up the color (technically doubling as a stain). It took us about a minute of rubbing our lips with a makeup wipe to remove the color, which was impressive for a low-cost product such as this one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We liked that this oil, though thin and very hydrating, never slipped off of our lips or feathered onto our skin in a greasy mess. Instead, it kept our lips looking luscious and tinted, acting like a stain and balm all in one. While the amount of product in the tube is somewhat small, we feel like the performance and price of this lip oil make this product a great segue into the world of lip oils for newbies and cost-conscious consumers alike.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.12 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Appleseed oil, cherry extract, peptides | <strong>Fragranced: </strong>No | <strong>Finish:</strong> Shiny | <strong>Shades:&nbsp;</strong>7<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-runner-up-nyx-fat-oil-lip-drip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget, Runner-Up</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYX Fat Oil Lip Drip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NYX Fat Oil Lip Drip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wO2UsbtI4M0l2M9bX73nGDlyt38=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nyx-fat-oil-lip-drip-8789bfa88b6f49888a104eacbfa44c67.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>NYX&nbsp;Cosmetics</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear/Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Lips still felt supple and hydrated after more than 30 minutes of wear</p></li><li readability=0><p>Dense consistency adds an impressive amount of hydration, thanks to the addition of squalane</p></li><li readability=0><p>Under $9, this product is the least expensive of the ones we tested</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Who doesn’t love a product that gets you that and high-shine pout without the high-end price tag? The NYX Fat Oil Lip Drip has the lowest price on our list, but soars in appearance and feel, making you do a double take when you see it only costs around $9. We had to scrub our lips clean before swiping on this oil, which left our lips feeling a bit dry, but one swipe of this juicy formula made our skin feel rejuvenated and more hydrated than ever.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our one qualm was that this formula felt a bit thick — almost like a gloss instead of an oil (it took a little bit of force to pull the wand from the tube, that’s how thick it was). But with its dense consistency came some serious hydration, which kept our lips looking and feeling supple after more than 30 minutes. We like to use this as the final act of our makeup routine, layering it over a lip liner for the look of a reflective gloss and the moisture of your go-to balm.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.16&nbsp; oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vegan squalane, raspberry oil, cloudberry oil | <strong>Fragranced: </strong>No | <strong>Finish:</strong> Shiny | <strong>Shades:&nbsp;</strong>8<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-milani-fruit-fetish-lip-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Drugstore</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Milani Fruit Fetish Lip Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Milani Fruit Fetish Lip Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/cQwNV37Ce0GpSBFEUGNfXJFt4OQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/milani-fruit-fetish-lip-oil-2586465ce8c5457084ce6f3c4d33bfac.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Milani&nbsp;Cosmetics</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear/Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Lightweight formula made with fruit extracts and vitamin E</p></li><li readability=1><p>We appreciated the thick doe-foot applicator, which made applying this lip gloss quick and effortless</p></li><li readability=0><p>Comes in four shades, including a more neutral Passionfruit Coconut option</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love a good drugstore beauty purchase, and the best lip oil at your local convenience store has to be the Milani Fruit Fetish Lip Oils. Dermatologist-loved ingredients like vitamin E oil and fruit extracts make up the delectable formula that is Milani’s lip oil, which provides the slick sheen of a gloss with the lightweight feel (and beneficial properties) of an oil at a considerably low price. With four tinted shades (Passionfruit Coconut being the most neutral), you can achieve a color-kissed look without messy layers of lipstick and gloss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A big doe-foot applicator is always a plus in our book, as it makes application quick and easy for on-the-go gloss. This fruity formula is a great option for shoppers wanting to test out lip oil without spending $20 or more, as this type of product can easily produce a high price tag. We do want to warn you that these flavors do come with artificial fruit fragrances, which may be a drawback to shoppers who are sensitive to strong scents. But if this isn’t a deterrent for you, we think you’ll love the fresh and flushed look that this drugstore buy provides.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.14 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin E, fruit extracts | <strong>Fragranced: </strong>Yes | <strong>Finish:</strong> Tinted, glossy | <strong>Shades: </strong>4<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-everyday-clarins-lip-comfort-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Everyday</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Clarins Lip Comfort Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta Clarins Lip Comfort Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XT2zjtWTT5H4mI2zjtI4K1R8tL0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/clarins-lip-comfort-oil-ccdf0e2c2dae438995b526abc1d9838d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear/Longevity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>This healing lip oil is dermatologist-recommended</p></li><li readability=1><p>Includes hydrating and calming ingredients like jojoba, rose, and hazelnut oil</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Eight shades makes it a multitasking product: a tint and oil all in one</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If an easy, everyday oil is what you’re after, then the Clarins Lip Comfort Oil is the answer to your wishes. Dr. Rachel Nazarian, board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City, noted this product as her favorite for a number of reasons. Nourishment is at the forefront of this product’s benefits thanks to its rich formula of natural oils, making it a saving grace for dry lips. “This product contains a high level of omega fatty acids, which can improve the hydration barrier, but also antioxidants (such as rose oil and jojoba) which are quite calming to skin,” Dr. Nazarian tells PEOPLE.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And no need to skimp out on application – doctor’s orders. “Because these ingredients have no addictive properties and only continue to hydrate better with continued use, I recommend using as needed, or even daily,” she added. The eight glossy shades that this oil is available in makes this product a tint and moisturizer all in one, so you can give your lips some TLC while rocking a fun color as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.2 oz. | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Organic sweetbriar rose, jojoba, and hazelnut oil | <strong>Fragranced: </strong>Yes | <strong>Finish:</strong> Glossy | <strong>Shades: </strong>8<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-spf-coola-organic-liplux-lip-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with SPF</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coola Organic Liplux Lip Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Coola Organic Liplux Lip Oil and Lip Gloss Sunscreen With SPF 30" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/cTHrzPGR1RtDOtkPYejJRPBLObE=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/COOLA-Lip-Oil-e58682486375414daa8f4a4a29c4a4f4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Coola</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Features SPF 30 to keep your lips protected from the sun</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Infused with jojoba and camellia oil for all-day hydration</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Features a neutral golden hue that is perfect for everyday wear</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=1><p>Because it has SPF, this isn't an oil you need to buy if you mostly wear lip oils in the evening or as an overnight mask</p></li><li readability=0><p>A bit smaller tube than most, so it won't last as long compared to some others we tested</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nowadays just about everything has SPF in it, but the types of products that often lack a sun protectant are anything for your lips.

We don’t think it’s necessary to reapply much, as the color will keep getting more intense with each swipe, but if you really want to pack a punch with your shade, then a few more layers never hurt.

Dubbed the “Plasma Lip Compound,” this formula transcends the categories of your average lip products, refusing to be pigeonholed as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lip plumper</a>, gloss, or oil.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This treatment comes in four colors and acts as a nurturing kiss of color and moisture. Using a mixture of peptides, salicylic acid, shea butter, and even more skin-loving ingredients, this delicate formula repaired our dry skin and plumped our lips into pillowy pouts, leaving a trace of color behind for that effortless look we all aspire towards. Plus, we loved how soothing that cool, metal applicator felt on our lips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the product was a little thick, it was very comfortable on our lips and never feathered or migrated onto our skin after applying it.

Each will consist of hydrating ingredients, but are you looking to use it solely as a moisturizing product, or do you want to add it as a finishing touch in your makeup routine? Why not both? You can easily utilize lip oils as skincare by applying before bed to seal in those remedial properties, or you can swipe it on as you do your makeup to soften your lips into a smooth base (healing oils like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Clarins Lip Comfort Oil</a> in shade “Honey” or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gisou Honey-Infused Lip Oil</a> are great for this).

Clear oils (like our pick from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Kopari Tri-Peptide Lip Cloud</a>) have the most versatility, as they can be worn on their own or in addition to other lip products.

But there are different healing properties to each ingredient being used, and some are objectively better than others. “Look for ingredients that are nourishing such as single-sourced oil extractions,” Aguilar advises. She goes on to explain that, “Vitamin E works as a natural preservative, so most clean, hydrating and minimal ingredient products have vitamin E oil.” Aguilar notes that her favorite oils for moisture include rose, grapeseed, and nut oils, which are all rich in omegas and beneficial for proper hydration — a combo you can find in plenty of our picks.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the absolute best lip oils, we conducted extensive research of the market and narrowed it down to 19 popular lip oils we wanted to try ourselves.
