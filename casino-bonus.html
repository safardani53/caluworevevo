The main goal of any bonus is to turn it into real money that you can withdraw.</p><p>You increase your chances of doing this in a few ways, considering the wagering requirements, stake contribution, and any exclusions. My job is to analyse multiple factors to determine if a bonus is worthwhile. Here’s how I rank bonuses:</p><ul><li><strong>Free spins or free bets</strong>&nbsp;- Depending on the online casino or online sportsbook that you choose, the type of welcome offer, and all other bonuses will vary. The value of the package is entirely dependent on its contents. Count up everything that’s on offer, including bonus casino funds, free spins, <a href=# aria-label="free bets (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">free bets</a>, or even the free cash on the table. Obviously, the bigger the sum total package, the better.</li><li><strong>Wagering requirements (WR)</strong>&nbsp;- Once you know exactly what you’re receiving, take a closer look at the fine print. If <a href=# aria-label="wagering requirements (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">wagering requirements</a>, also called wagering contributions, and your wagering contribution have a huge impact on your chances of turning a bonus into real cash funds. These dictate the number of times you need to churn, or turn over, your bonus cash, bonus spins, or bonus bet winnings before they can be withdrawn. If you don't meet these, it will render your bonus win amount non-withdrawable. Wagering requirements of 35x are the highest you should accept.</li><li><strong>Timeframes</strong>&nbsp;- Bonuses very rarely last indefinitely. Most of the time, the customer is given a couple of expiry dates. One date stipulates the time you have to activate or accept the bonus, and the other date dictates how long you have to use your bonus before it expires. The time offered should be long enough to allow you a fair shot at meeting the wagering requirements. Usually, a minimum of 14 days is standard.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Game and bonus restrictions</strong>&nbsp;- Every bonus offer comes with a set of casino bonus conditions. As well as covering wagering requirements and time limits, they also include details on game restrictions like the max spin winnings amount, max bonus conversion, min dep, max lines, max bonus credit, the minimum value you must deposit to activate the bonus, and the <a href=# aria-label="casino games (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">casino games</a> you’re permitted to play. For example, you receive max 70 free spins that can only be played on Book of Dead or Starburst, or your 70% deposit match bonus can’t be used for bonus bets on blackjack or roulette <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>live table games</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The-SUN-Best-Casino-Bonus-Sites-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the top casino welcome bonuses for UK players?</h2><p>Here are my favourite online casinos with great welcome offers for new players:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. <a href=# aria-label="Duelz Casino (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Duelz Casino</a></h3><p>Big fan of pixies, elves and fantasy in general?

The wagering requirement of up to x40 on this promo is not as appealing, but the table/slot games that this offer can be used on are.</p><p>There is also a large choice of ongoing bonuses at Winomania to grab on a regular basis.

To bag this bonus deal, you simply need to deposit at least £10 and then stake at least £10 on casino, Vegas or live games.</p><p>Betway is another UK casino which places great emphasis on looking after existing customers.

Once you have registered a new account, deposited at least £20 into it and spent at least £20 on Games Global games, these goodies will be credited instantly to enjoy.</p><p>Although there may be a steep x50 wagering requirement on the deposit match bonus, the free spins come with no wagering rules at all.

Your options are numerous.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reload bonuses</h2><p>Your first deposit is generally rewarded and enhanced by a <strong>welcome offer</strong>. Of course, these are always optional. However, most online casinos also award players <strong>additional boosts on their second and third deposits too</strong>. Once these are exhausted, you can still expect a range of reload bonuses to come your way. These are usually a deposit match or boost of bonus cash, allowing you to get more out of your deposit.&nbsp;</p><p><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Check out the best reload bonus casinos</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Loyalty bonuses</h2><p>Many online casinos now feature <a href=# aria-label="loyalty programs (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">loyalty programs</a>. Known as VIP Clubs in some cases, they offer rewards to players who consistently deposit money and place bets. A host of bonuses are available, including free spins, reload bonuses and cashback.&nbsp;</p><p>Through loyalty programs, it is also possible to earn additional rewards, such as faster withdrawals, a personal account manager and birthday bonuses. Some loyalty/VIP programs also feature different levels. The rewards increase in generosity as you reach higher tiers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Exclusive casino bonuses for British players</h2><p>Casinos rarely only service bettors from a single country. Most of the time, they allow players from all around the world to register and play. Casinos must adhere to country restrictions, as each has its own gambling regulations. Bonuses are rarely one size fits all. <strong>Casinos will build promos and offers specifically for UK players. </strong>These are generally tailored around British customer preferences, including sports, slot providers, and spins vs bonus cash, or both.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>No deposit casino bonuses</h2><p><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">No deposit casino bonuses</a> are rarer than regular welcome bonuses. These award new players the option to acquire bonus cash, free spins or anything else before even making a single deposit. The thing you should know about no-deposit casino bonuses is that <strong>they’re usually much smaller than the welcome offer</strong>, and the wagering requirements are higher. Even if your bonus translated into a win, you’ll eventually have to deposit anyway in order to play through the bonus win and turn it into cash.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Free spins casino offers for players in the UK</h2><p>UK players usually get free spins, bonus cash or both. <a aria-label="Free Spins (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Free spins</a> are a fantastic, risk-free way to experience a slot game. However, as with everything else in life, <strong>free doesn’t actually mean ‘free’</strong>. You’ll either have to make a qualifying deposit to unlock your free spins, or they’ll come attached to wagering requirements. In some cases, both a deposit and a wagering rollover are required. Free spins are easy to collect on a regular basis from your casino’s promo section, or as an automatic bonus amount applied to your account. Once the bonus amount has been applied to your account, it is important to note that the bonus is cashable, meaning that you can withdraw the bonus funds as real money after meeting the wagering requirements set by the casino.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Deposit bonuses</h2><p>Deposit bonuses are simply a way to <strong>raise the value of your deposit by tacking on some bonus cash.</strong> These are usually calculated in percentages of 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%. For example, a 100% deposit bonus means that if you deposit £30, you’ll get another £30 in bonus cash on top. A 50% bonus means that if you deposit £30, you'll get another £15 in bonus cash on top. <strong>Your bonus cash comes with wagering requirements. </strong>These can be as low as 5x, but they usually come in at about 35x. I don’t recommend accepting wagering requirements higher than this.</p><p>Higher match bonuses of 200% and 300% are not as common at legally run and licensed casinos in the UK. It goes without saying that you should steer clear when you see wagering bonuses that seem too good to be true. Look for a casino site with clearly outlined wagering requirements and a UKGC licence, if possible.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Casino bonuses for British high rollers</h2><p>If you’re more of a high roller than a recreational player, then small £50 bonuses and a handful of free spins are unlikely to hit the spot. Instead, most quality casinos will devise large batch deposit offers, specially designed for newcomers and regulars who prefer playing with big cash stakes. These offers generally cater towards large deposits of well over £100, usually £500 or even £1,000. The free spins that come attached are also boosted in value. Whereas usually, each game round is worth 1p coin size, 10p or 20p, high roller spins carry a value of about £1 per spin. Naturally, the rewards for getting every required fruit symbol on the line are much higher.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best live casino bonuses</h2><p>Live casino or live dealer games are a hugely popular addition to the standard online casino space. They allow people to get a real, in-person casino experience by connecting with live dealers from home or on the go. Because they’re so inherently different, <strong>live casino bonuses are completely separate to regular bonuses. </strong>These give you the chance to win real cash every time you get <a aria-label="blackjack (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blackjack</a>, or unlock real cash wagers on specific games. As a general rule, casinos that host live games from Evolution Gaming come with the best live casino bonuses.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mobile casino bonus offers for players on the go</h2><p>Many new online casinos come with a mobile app, with software for both iOS and Android, that works alongside the website. Operators will frequently incentivise players to download the app and register by sms verification, by offering special bonuses. <strong>These can range from deposit bonuses </strong>that can only be accessed through the app,<strong> to real cash or free spins </strong>just to say thanks.</p><p>Often, a mobile casino app will have a completely different set of bonuses, specially <strong>designed for gamblers on the go</strong>, or those who simply prefer playing on a mobile device. SMS validation can also be used as part of two-factor authentication, to make sure that it's really you claiming the bonus on your behalf.</p><p><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Take a look at our complete betting apps guide for more offers!</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to get the free spins casino bonus</h2><li><strong>Choose your favorite casino or sportsbook</strong>.

You might be asked to use code 'xyz' for example or to simply opt-in.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Make your first deposit</strong>. &nbsp;Visit the cashier to fund your account with a variety from a variety of deposit types. These can be debit card payments, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>VISA</a>, Mastercard, e-wallets, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>PayPal</a>, deposit only Paysafecard, prepaid cards, Neteller, Skrill, etc. Read the terms and conditions for any relevant card restrictions that might apply to you.</li><li><strong>Check out the promo page regularly</strong>. Most casinos have a promo page that houses all bonus offers and their player restrictions, game contributions, max win, max bet, and so on. Once you find a promotion that's the right fit, simply follow the qualification instructions to activate the offer.</li><p>Note to punters: To avoid any bonus withdrawal issue with bookmakers and casinos, you'll be asked to provide proof of i.d. before you can transfer funds to your bank account. This includes your full name, address, account currency, and all the rest.&nbsp;Always check withdrawal terms before signing up for a casino.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tips on how to get the most out of your casino bonus</h2><p>&nbsp;With any bonus, your strategy should be to maximize payouts, make the most of the bonus features and find a way around every restriction. My review recommends some top bonus casinos, but here's some information to keep in mind:</p><li><strong>Do some basic mathematics.</strong>&nbsp;Don’t accept the max bonus. If the top offer is £200, find out what the minimum payout is on each bonus, and choose a value that falls in between. This will give you a greater chance of meeting the rollover requirement.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Pay attention to game </strong>weighting requirements. Game weighting refers to the percentage of a wager that counts towards the wagering rollover, with slots usually counting at 100%, while table games may have lower weighting requirements of 50% or even 10%. You won't be able to make any withdrawals from bonus funds until you've wagered them enough times.</li><li><strong>Look out for wager-free spins.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes you can collect free spins winnings with zero wagering requirements. These have great bonus value because if you win on these, they can help you to build up your balance and turn over the bonus cash.</li><li><strong>Look out for variance.</strong>&nbsp;Before you choose a slot to play your bonus cash on, do a little research. All slot reviews (and many casino reviews) will tell you if the game is low, medium, or high variance. For the purposes of meeting wagering requirements, it’s best to stick to med and low variance slots as these will generate smaller, yet more frequent, wins.</li><li><strong>Play smart.</strong>&nbsp;Always gamble responsibly and don't abuse bonuses, so the experience remains fun. A reputable casino will also run affordability checks. You should never assume your stake will win, and absolutely never risk more cash than you can afford. If you succeed in a positive result with your bonus, remember that you got lucky, and don’t assume you’ll get the same result twice!</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>New player vs existing player bonuses compared</h2><p>I'm going to come right out and say it: A <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">welcome bonus </a>made for brand-new depositors is always going to be the best matchup bonus you get during your time on the site. But that doesn’t mean you should hop from site to site, making new accounts in pursuit of welcome offers.</p><p>Since welcome offers can't be used in conjunction with any other offers, <strong>there’s still plenty of value to be had by sticking around.</strong> In fact, some might argue that loyalty pays far more in the long run. While new players scoop up the largest bonus bundle, <strong>loyal members get to take advantage of their loyalty based on their lifetime deposits.</strong> There's always something to play for, like reload bonuses, gifted cash and bonus cash, wager-free spins, and deposit matches. On top of all that, you’ll usually also collect a birthday bonus, and amass VIP points over time. The latter can be converted into real cash, bonus cash, or spins.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take a look at our guide to betting offers for existing customers for more details!</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How do wagering requirements and terms and conditions on casino bonuses in the UK work?</h2><p>It is generally the terms and conditions that separate the best casino bonuses from the rest.&nbsp; There are a number of points to consider, with wagering requirements perhaps being the most important. I will discuss this in more detail later on. However, this is the number of times that a bonus must be rolled over before it effectively turns into cash.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the majority of promotions come with an expiration date. Any funds left after this timeframe will likely be forfeited. Unfortunately for players, another common condition of a bonus is maximum winnings. As such, even if you win more than this amount, you will not be allowed to claim the total value.&nbsp;</p><p>When spending bonus money, there will often be both eligible and ineligible games. So, be sure to check out how different games contribute towards the wagering requirements. For example, slots could contribute 100%, compared to just 10% for live casino games. Finally, a bonus may be excluded for players in certain countries. So, ensure that UK players can qualify first. Below, I have provided an example of how you can qualify for a welcome bonus at an online casino:</p><li>Enter the casino site and sign up by completing the registration form. You may need to enter a promo code or opt-in for bonuses at this point.&nbsp;</li><li>Login to your account and deposit money using an eligible payment method. Be sure to meet the minimum deposit amount in order to qualify.</li><li>Within 48 hours of your deposit being processed, you will receive your welcome bonus.</li><li>Meet the wagering requirements before the bonus expires by placing bets on eligible games.&nbsp;</li><li>If successful, either withdraw winnings or spend the money on future bets.&nbsp;</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will I be able to withdraw my winnings if I use a bonus?</h2><p>How easily you can withdraw winnings from a bonus will depend on the specific promotion. Many bonuses offered by online casinos come with wagering requirements. When in place, you must overcome the wagering requirements before you can withdraw funds. 35x is the average amount for wagering requirements. However, it can possibly be higher or lower.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did my casino bonus expire?&nbsp;</h2><p>The vast majority of casino bonuses come with an expiration period. As such, if you still have bonus funds remaining once the promotion has expired then you will likely forfeit them. So, be sure to meet the wagering requirements before this time.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What casino pays out the most in the UK?</h2><p>Some online casinos have a better reputation than others when it comes to payouts. This refers to the amount that you can expect to win from money bet. It is important to select a high payout casino, with options in the UK including MrQ, Magic Red and LeoVegas. You can also consider the <a href=# aria-label="RTP (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">RTP</a> of specific casino games. For example, if the RTP is 97%, you can expect to make £97 from every £100 wagered, on average.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How do I turn my UK casino bonus into cash?</h2><p>I have already outlined the fact that most casino bonuses in the UK come with wagering requirements. Only once you have reached the wagering requirements will funds be transferred into cash. From there, you can use this money to place future bets or just withdraw immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Be sure to read the bonus terms and conditions before signing up and depositing. This is because some games may be ineligible, while some will contribute more towards the wagering requirements than others. For example, if you claim a £50 bonus with 30x wagering requirements, you must place £1,500 worth of bets (50x30).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are there any theme-based bonuses?</h2><p>Of course there are. Here are some of them:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why I like online casino bonuses - and why should you?</h2><p>If you read through this entire blog, you’re already aware that casino bonuses are the best way to get your cash deposits to stretch. Whether it's a match bonus, a 1st deposit offer, or a registration bonus,&nbsp;<strong>you’ll get more to play with, allowing you the opportunity to try more games.</strong>&nbsp;Free spins are often linked to top casino slots like Starburst, Big Bass Bonanza, Double Bubble, Big Boom Riches, Big Bass Splash, and Monopoly Paradise Mansion. So long as you choose a fair bonus, with reasonable wagering requirements, you’ll have a reasonably good chance of turning over the offer or spin winnings and transforming them into real, withdrawable cash.&nbsp;</p><p>Casino bonuses add to the fun,&nbsp;<strong>boosting your bonus funds and transforming your deposit into an entertainment package</strong>&nbsp;worth getting excited about. Furthermore, you get more time to play games from top game providers such as Microgaming, NetEnt, Play'n GO, and many others. Bonus wins are always on the menu, just keep an eye on the deposit amount, spin value, bonus terms, and wager requirements before entering the promo codes.</p><p>If you are reading this from Ireland then check out the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best casino bonuses for Irish players</a>.</p><h2><strong>Remember to gamble responsibly</strong></h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesn’t gamble if they’re upset, angry, or depressed</li><li>Gamcare –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>Find our <a href=# aria-label="detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here</a>.</p><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamstop.co.uk</a>&nbsp;to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Betting</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jpucrayZo7Rwfo9wbG1waWp8pK3SoqWoZZKku7a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fcasino-bonus.html&title=Best%20Casino%20Bonuses%20UK%3a%20Top%20Casino%20Bonus%20Sites%20%28January%202024%29" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcasino-bonus.html&description=Best%20Casino%20Bonuses%20UK%3a%20Top%20Casino%20Bonus%20Sites%20%28January%202024%29" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcasino-bonus.html&title=Best%20Casino%20Bonuses%20UK%3a%20Top%20Casino%20Bonus%20Sites%20%28January%202024%29" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fcasino-bonus.html&title=Best%20Casino%20Bonuses%20UK%3a%20Top%20Casino%20Bonus%20Sites%20%28January%202024%29" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fcasino-bonus.html&text=Best%20Casino%20Bonuses%20UK%3a%20Top%20Casino%20Bonus%20Sites%20%28January%202024%29" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fcasino-bonus.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Larita Shotwell</h3></div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./celebrities-who-used-to-be-exotic-dancers.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Celebrities Who Used to Be Exotic Dancers</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./what-happened-tanya-little-women-atlanta.html><h3>Atlanta'?
