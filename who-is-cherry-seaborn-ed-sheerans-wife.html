Nearly two years later, the couple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>welcomed their first child</a>, daughter Lyra Antarctica, and in May 2022, their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>second child</a>, daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Jupiter</a>, arrived.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While pregnant with Jupiter, Seaborn was diagnosed with cancer. She spoke publicly about her health for the first time in Sheeran's Disney+ docuseries, Ed Sheeran: The Sum of It All, which premiered in May 2023. The "Shivers" singer also opened up about his wife and how much she means to him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everything in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>my life got so much better when Cherry got into it</a>," Sheeran can be heard saying in the series trailer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite her high-profile relationship, Seaborn is a private person who doesn't have public social media accounts and tends to stay out of the spotlight.

During an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>interview</a> on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Armchair Expert</a> with Dax Shepard, Sheeran said that if they had dated back then, "it would have been a disaster."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The friends lost touch when Sheeran went on tour and Seaborn headed to Duke University in North Carolina. In 2015, however, the pair reconnected in N.Y.C. after a mutual friend invited them both out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One day, she was in New York and she went to go out with Cherry because Cherry worked on Wall Street," Sheeran shared on the podcast of his friend and touring buddy Lauren. "And then she was like, 'Oh Cherry Seaborn is in town, do you want to hang out?' I was like, 'Yes.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He went on to say that he had been nervous about seeing Seaborn again, since the last time they were together, they had "hooked up." "So in my head, I was like what if she remembers that because it was like a while ago. It was very innocent.
